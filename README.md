# CNN-demo: Dynamic Demonstration of Convolutional Neural Networks

This project provides a dynamic visualization of how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) work. It visually presents the internal mathematical operations, helping learners intuitively understand core concepts like convolution and pooling.

## 📖 Usage Guide

The core of this project is **dynamic visualization**. Follow these steps to experience it:

1.  **Access the Page**: Open the link above.
2.  **Observe the Architecture**: The page displays a classic CNN flow (Input -> Convolution or Pooling -> Output).
3.  **Watch the Animation**:
    *   **Sliding Window**: Observe how the Kernel slides across the input matrix.
    *   **Real-time Calculation**: Watch how the values in the Feature Map are generated through multiplication and addition operations at each step.
    *   **Data Flow**: Follow the animation to see how features are extracted from raw data layer by layer.

## 💡 Project Highlights

### Concept
**CNN Dynamic Demonstration**: moving away from static formulas to explain complex neural network algorithms through dynamic graphical language.

### Key Knowledge Points
This project embodies three core computer science paradigms:
*   **Abstraction**: Modeling complex mathematical logic into visual elements.
*   **Modularization**: Breaking down network layers into independent, reusable functional modules.
*   **Divide and Conquer Paradigm**: Decomposing massive network computations into local matrix operation units.

### Innovation
*   **Intuitive Mathematical Presentation**: It doesn't just show the result; it visualizes the *process*, making the "black box" transparent by animating the underlying math.

## 🤖 About AI

This project maintains transparency regarding the use of AI tools:

1.  **Coding Phase**:
    *   This project was developed with **almost no AIGC**.
    *   The code was written manually, with the exception of standard code autocompletion provided by VS Code's built-in Copilot.

2.  **Background & Inspiration**:
    *   Before starting this project, I completed another work, [**Dynamic Demonstration of Transformer**](https://ranger-liang.github.io/Dynamic-Demonstrate-of-Transformer/), under the guidance of **Gemini-3.0-pro**.
    *   **Learning by Analysis**: The code architecture and design details of this CNN demo reference that Transformer project. My knowledge of web development for this project was primarily derived from a deep analysis and ablation study of that previous AI-guided work.
